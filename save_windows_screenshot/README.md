## Save Windows Screenshot as jpg File using a Shortcut Key
Using the two included scripts, taking a screenshot and saving it to an image file becomes a three step process:
1. Win+Shift+S for taking the screenshot
2. Ctrl+Alt+F for opening a designated folder (optional)
3. Ctrl+Alt+I for saving the image as a file and letting me rename the file immediately

The keyboard shortcuts are for you to choose.
