## Hi
I'm manisar ([manisar2](https://github.com/manisar2/manisar2) on Github).<br>
A coder by hobby, I also find immense interest in physics and calculus.

You can find me on the following platforms sharings bits and pieces of knowledge.<br>
Among these, [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/) is where I've contributed the most because of its great flexibility and control over presentation.

 1. [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/)
 2. [github](https://github.com/manisar2/manisar2)
 3. [physics.stackexchange.com](https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/306389/manisar) and other stackexchange sites such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8582902/manisar)
 5. [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Manisar)
 6. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNk8sEOPQKfYxYOdWcI3uA) (through [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/))

I'm currently into Python and machine learning.


Find below some of my code snipptes, tools, reference guides and musings.


## Online Tools

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Monty Hall Paradox Test Tool](https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/monty-hall-paradox-tool/)</font><!-- <img src="images/Monty_Hall_Pic.png" style="float:right; max-height:125px; margin-left:5px;" /><br> -->
   Though generally described for 3 doors, the more generalized version as explained in [this page]((https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/monty-hall-paradox-tool/)) can help us understand why it works.<br>
   In the tool given on [here](https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/monty-hall-paradox-tool/), we can modify the total number of doors (n), the doors selected by the host (y), then the doors opened from those selected doors (x), and the total number of winning doors (t).
   The computer plays against itself 100,000 times and shows the number of wins as per different strategies.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Extract Subtitles from YouTube in Plain Text, SRT or VTT Formats](https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/extract-subtitles-youtube-and-convert-plain-text/)</font>
   Use this tool for downloading captions or subtitles from YouTube in plain text or in VTT or SRT formats, in the language of your choice.<br>
   It can also be used for converting any subtitles, that you already have, from VTT format to text or SRT format.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Knight's Tour on A Chessboard](https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/knight-solution/)</font><!-- <img src="images/Knights_Tour_Solved.jpg" style="float:right; max-height:125px; margin-left:5px;" /><br> -->
   It's possible for a knight on a chessboard to traverse the complete board visiting every position once and only once.<br>
   Here I'm using backtracking to find such a tour starting with any position. Press '1' in any cell in the grid below and hit Submit.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Online Sudoku Solver](https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/sudoku-solver/)</font><!-- <img src="images/Solved_Sudoku.jpg" style="float:right; max-height:125px; margin-left:5px;" /><br> -->
   This page can also be used as service that solves a 9x9 Sudoku. The service is written in Python.<br>
   With the solved Sudoku, the service also returns some other statistics such as the counts of recursive and non-recursive calls etc.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Scrape Stock Quotes](https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/stock-quotes/)</font>
   This is a demo tool that shows how web-scraping can be used to get stock quotes in interesting ways, and in bulk, e.g. from Google Finance.

## IT and Mathematics - Concepts and Explanations

 * ### <font size="4rem">[The Monty Hall Paradox Probability Equations](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/monty-hall-paradox-probability-equations/)</font>
   While in [Monty Hall Paradox Test Tool]((https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/monty-hall-paradox-tool/)) I focused on explaining the working of this paradox through its results, [here](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/monty-hall-paradox-probability-equations/) I have derived the equations for the generalized case (for any number of total, opened and winning doors).<br>
   Nice to see how the results match the equations.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Neural Networks - What's Happening? An Intuitive Introduction to Machine Learning](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/information-technology/neural-networks-whats-happening-intuitive-intro-to-machine-learning/)</font>
   Multiple chapters.<br>Trying to explain how machine learning is a natural progression of conventional regression using the rapidly advancing processing power, and some of the neat small mathematical tricks we had or discovered in the last century.<br>
   This, while also shaping up the constructing ideas behind it from the ground-up - for the semi-initiated.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Information Theory - Rationale Behind Using Logarithm for Entropy, and Other Explanations](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/information-theory-rationale-behind-using-logarithm-entropy-and-other-explanations/)</font>
   If you work in, or have interest in Information Technology or Mathematics, then Information Theory is something you must be acquainted with.<br>
   If you haven't heard of it, check the section Information Theory - Quick Introduction↕ on this page.<br>
   What I have provided on this is an intuitive build-up which is generally not present in most explanations of the Information Theory - including the one that came from its founder.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[An Intuitive Look at Euler's Formula (and All the Numbers!)](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/intuitive-look-at-eulers-formula-and-all-numbers/)</font><br>
   If enlightenment came in pieces, I bet the realization which I had and which I've provided on this page, would be one of those!

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Standard Deviation (σ) vs. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/standard-deviation-vs-mean-absolute-deviation/)</font>
   On a cursory look, MAD seems to be perfect – we want to know – on an average – how far each of the numbers in a set of observations is from their mean (M), and MAD tells us exactly that.<br>
   Then what is the problem? Why don’t we use MAD everywhere instead of σ?

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Numpy Array - Sum, Axes and Dimensions](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/information-technology/concepts/numpy-array-sum-axes-and-dimensions/)</font>
   A little visualization for understanding this basic stuff.
   You can also look at this [animation](https://randompearls.com/documents/19/Numpy_Array_Sum_Animation.mp4) for a quick overview.

   A humble attempt at explaining the relativity of physics and the physics of relativity, with special treatment to vector analysis.<br>
   Some knowledge of calculus is required.
