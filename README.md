### Hi
I'm manisar ([manisar2](https://github.com/manisar2/manisar2) on Github).<br>
A coder by hobby, I also find immense interest in physics and calculus.

You can find me on the following platforms sharings bits and pieces of knowledge.<br>
Among these, [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/) is where I've contributed the most because of its great flexibility and control over presentation.
