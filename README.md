## Hi
I'm manisar ([manisar2](https://github.com/manisar2/manisar2) on Github).<br>
While coding is both my hobby and occupation, I also find immense interest in physics and calculus.

You can find me on the following platforms sharings bits and pieces of knowledge.<br>
Among these, [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/) is where I've contributed the most because of its great flexibility and control over presentation.

 1. [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/)
 2. [github](https://github.com/manisar2/manisar2)
 3. [physics.stackexchange.com](https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/306389/manisar) and other stackexchange sites such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8582902/manisar)
 5. [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Manisar)
 6. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNk8sEOPQKfYxYOdWcI3uA) (through [randompearls.com](https://randompearls.com/search/author/2/))

I'm currently into Python and machine learning.

Find below some of the code snippets, tools, reference guides and musings authored by me.

   It has some cool features still absent from Windows explorer search, such as multi-directory search, using max depth and file size, hot-search, showing tree-view in the results, exporting to Excel or html etc.

## Mathematical Animations
   Blender, manim, desmos, dot and Voicemeeter are the tools I've primarily used for animation.

## IT and Mathematics - Concepts and Explanations

 * ### <font size="4rem">[The Monty Hall Paradox Probability Equations](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/monty-hall-paradox-probability-equations/)</font>
   While in [Monty Hall Paradox Test Tool]((https://randompearls.com/reference/tools/monty-hall-paradox-tool/)) I focused on explaining the working of this paradox through its results, [here](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/monty-hall-paradox-probability-equations/) I have derived the equations for the generalized case (for any number of total, opened and winning doors).<br>
   Nice to see how the results match the equations.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Neural Networks - What's Happening? An Intuitive Introduction to Machine Learning](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/information-technology/neural-networks-whats-happening-intuitive-intro-to-machine-learning/)</font>
   Multiple chapters.<br>Trying to explain how machine learning is a natural progression of conventional regression using the rapidly advancing processing power, and some of the neat small mathematical tricks we had or discovered in the last century.<br>
   This, while also shaping up the constructing ideas behind it from the ground-up - for the semi-initiated.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Information Theory - Rationale Behind Using Logarithm for Entropy, and Other Explanations](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/information-theory-rationale-behind-using-logarithm-entropy-and-other-explanations/)</font>
   If you work in, or have interest in Information Technology or Mathematics, then Information Theory is something you must be acquainted with.<br>
   If you haven't heard of it, check the section Information Theory - Quick Introduction on the linked page.<br>
   What I have provided on this page is an intuitive build-up which is generally not present in most explanations of the Information Theory - including the one that came from its founder.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[An Intuitive Look at Euler's Formula (and All the Numbers!)](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/intuitive-look-at-eulers-formula-and-all-numbers/)</font><br>
   If enlightenment came in pieces, I bet the realization which I had and which I've provided on this page, would be one of those!

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Standard Deviation (σ) vs. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/mathematics/standard-deviation-vs-mean-absolute-deviation/)</font>
   On a cursory look, MAD seems to be perfect – we want to know – on an average – how far each of the numbers in a set of observations is from their mean (M), and MAD tells us exactly that.<br>
   Then what is the problem? Why don’t we use MAD everywhere instead of σ?

 * ### <font size="4rem">[Numpy Array - Sum, Axes and Dimensions](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/information-technology/concepts/numpy-array-sum-axes-and-dimensions/)</font>
   A little visualization for understanding this basic stuff.
   You can also look at this [animation](https://randompearls.com/documents/19/Numpy_Array_Sum_Animation.mp4) for a quick overview.

 * ### <font size="4rem">[The Relativity of Physics and The Physics of Relativity](https://randompearls.com/science-and-technology/physics/relativity-physics-physics-relativity/)</font>
   A humble attempt at explaining the relativity of physics and the physics of relativity, with special treatment to vector analysis.<br>
   Some knowledge of calculus is required.
